# Backup #
Container based implementation of backup. Features:
  - rsync to destination system
  - can backup IMAP accounts
  - Plugin system allows adding other types of data
  - History Mode preserves deleted files or old versions optimizing space by using hard links

# Destinations #
Destination can be anything that is reachable via rsync/ssh or a local disk mounted in the container. Copying via internet is supported.

## History Mode ##
History mode safes the backup to a subdirectory YYYY/mm/dd based on the backup
date (today, unless --histdate is used). In order to save space, starting from
the second backup we are hard-linking to unchanged filed of previous backup.

# Sources #
backup supports currently the following sources:
  - IMAP
  - File

# How to use #
## Easy use 
Start a container and pass the parameters (see below) for one action to this container.  
This way of usage is recommended for testing and small number data storages.

## Complex configurations
  - Create your own custom script
  - This script can contain multiple backup actions. see [Example][1]
  - mount this script e.g. on /backup into container
  - give ". <scriptname>" as parameter to the container

This way of usage is recommended if you have a number of backup actions and
other complex setups.

## parameters defining a backup action
  1. "backup" (fix)
  2. Type (currently only "imap" or "file" supported)
  3. Source
  4. Destination
  5. global options
  6. '--'
  7. local options (specific to "type", see relevant section)

see also [Example][1].

## Global Options
  - --runonsrc
    Prefer to run on the source side
  - --runondst
    Prefer to run on destination side
	- --local
    Run locally (=in the container) only
  - --srcsecret
    Secret to access source system (password/ssh-key, depending on type)
  - --dstsecret
    Secret to access destination system (password/ssh-key, depending on type)
  - --hist
    Backup in History Mode (see separate section)
  - --histdate <date>
    Backup in History Mode, using <date> instead of today. Not intended for production use, but mainly for testing 
  - --histraw <YYYY/mm/dd>
    Backup in History Mode, using fixed subdirectory as target. Only intended for internal use

## Environment Parameters #
  - DEBUG: 0 or 1, defaults to 0

# IMAP
Backups data from an IMAP Server using offlineimap. This is done in a delta
approach, so only modified Emails are downloaded whereas deleted EMails are
deleted on the file directory

### IMAP Global parameters
  * Source - Logon user used to connect to the IMAP Server. Typically it
    contains the Email including the domain.
  * Destination - Directory where to store the downloaded EMails. Optionally
    prefixed by Server name followed by a colon.
  * Source Secret
    is the password to logon to the server \[mandatory\]
  * Destination Secret
    is the password to connect to the target server \[optional\]

### IMAP local parameters
  1. IMAP Server Url (e.g. imap.mydomain.xxx:143) 
     \[mandatory\]

# File
Backups data from any server reachable via rsync and/or ssh. It is based on
rsync, so only modified files are copied (delta-approach). No more existing
files are deleted in the target.

### File Global paramaters
  * Source - Directoy of Files to be backed up. Optionally prefixed by Server
    name folloed by a colon
  * Destination - Directory where to store the downloaded EMails. Optionally
    prefixed by Server name followed by a colon.
  * Source Secret
    is the password to logon to the server \[optional\]
    mandatory if the Source is remote
  * Destination Secret
    is the password to connect to the target server \[optional\]
    mandatory if the Destination is remote

# rclone
Backups data from various Clouds, leveraging [rclone](https://rclone.org/).

### rcone Global paramaters
  * Source - Name of the cloud in rclone config
  * Destination - Directory where to store the download.
    Optionally prefixed by Server name followed by a colon.
  * Source Secret - rclone.conf file to be used

# Security (Secrets)
Each remote system needs a Secret for Authentication and authorisation.
Typical form of Secrets are public keys or passwords. If needed, Secrets can
be defined with the --srcsecret or --dstsecret parameter. Starting from
version 0.2.1 no Defaults are applied.

# Rebasing history backups
Rebasing a history backup in order to save space can be done. You need to start rebasing on the first backup that introduced the files to be based on other data
and then rebase each of the existing backups up to the latest.
a sample command could be:

    rsync -v -aHX --delete --progress --link-dest=../../../../../user_home/2021/11/20 --link-dest=../20 20/ 20.rsync-rebase.tmp

# Future Plans #
Features planned in the future
  - can backup mysql databases
  - can backup Samba configuration
  - Find a way to improve sync to cloud when files / directories have
    been moved. It would be fantastic if we can reuse files that are
    already present in the backup.

# Hacking #
If you want to develop and test on MacOS, you need:
  - brew install offlineimap jq bash rsync rclone
  - activated local ssh server
  - trust your own ssh key (e.g. ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub must be in authorized_keys)
  - tested with docker desktop for Mac

To run tests in test subdirectory you need to have some test data available. ATTENTION: Test data will be DELETED on every run, so make sure you donÂ´t have any data on it!
  - IMAP Test Account

    Setup an IMAP Test Account and set Environment variables $MAIL_ADR, $MAIL_SRV and $MAIL_PW accordingly
  - rclone Test Cloud

    Setup a Test-Cloud (I use Microsoft OneDrive that is for free).
    Create an rclone.cfg and pass its filename in $RCLONE_CONF and the Cloud config to be used in $RCLONE_NAME.
    You may wan to use something like
    ```rclone --config ./rclonf.conf config``` to create the file.

start with running test/test to verify your environment
